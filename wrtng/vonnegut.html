    <br>
    Use the time of a total stranger in such a way that he or she will not feel the time was wasted.
    <br>
    Give the reader at least one character he or she can root for.
    <br>
    Every character should want something, even if it is only a glass of water.
    <br>
    
    Every sentence must do one of two things â€” reveal character or advance the action.
    <br>
    <br>
    Start as close to the end as possible.
    <br>
    <br>Be a Sadist. No matter how sweet and innocent your leading characters, make awful things happen to 
    them-in order that the reader may see what they are made of.
    <br>
    <br>Write to please just one person. If you open a window and make love to the world, so to speak, your 
    story will get pneumonia.
    <br>
    <br>Give your readers as much information as possible as soon as possible. To hell with suspense. 
    <br>Readers should have such complete understanding of what is going on, where and why, that they could finish the story themselves, should cockroaches eat the last few pages.
